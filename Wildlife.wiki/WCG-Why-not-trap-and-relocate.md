# Trapping

Trapping an animal is perceived as a quick fix, but it's not likely to solve your problem. In many cases, it makes the problem worse: 

- Trapping and removing wildlife is a short-term solution because it doesn't address what is attracting animals to a specific site in the first place. As long as food attractants (garbage, outdoor pet food) and den sites remain at the initial location, other animals will soon replace those who are removed. 
- Trapped animals are often nursing mothers whose young get left behind when the mom is taken away. As a result, the young die of starvation. (Baby raccoons who have been orphaned can suffer for up to 10 days before dying.) 
- Setting a trap does not guarantee that you will catch the individual or even the species of animal causing the conflict; it's common for other animals (including pets) to be lured into the trap. 
- Despite being marketed as humane, live traps can be dangerous and cause animals to suffer. Trapped animals can severely injure themselves in their frantic attempts to escape. When left too long in a trap or when exposed to extreme weather conditions, they can even die. 

# Relocating

Relocating animals may sound like a good solution, but it's not. Studies show that relocated animals have extremely low survival rates due to: 

- Territorial disputes with resident animals. 
- Inability to find food, water and den sites. 
- No knowledge of safe areas or "escape corridors" to hide or get away from predators.
- Increased movement across roads in an effort to return "home" or to get back to their young. 

Furthermore, state wildlife laws may prohibit the relocation of certain species due to the fact that relocating animals outside of their home range may spread disease to surrounding wildlife populations. 

# Euthanizing

Euthanizing healthy wildlife is not an acceptable solution; it should not be considered as an alternative to relocation. It is costly, time-consuming and entirely unnecessary for successful conflict resolution. 

In addition to the ethical issues mentioned above, trapping, relocating or euthanizing wildlife won't solve the root causes of conflicts among people, pets and wildlife. These "solutions" are, therefore, ineffective. For tips on humanely and effectively dealing with wildlife conflicts, please visit wildneighbors.org.

# What's Wrong With Trap-loan Programs?

As a local shelter or animal control facility, you might loan traps to the public in an attempt to accommodate public calls about wildlife conflicts and to let callers handle issues themselves. The Humane Society of the United States strongly discourages trap-loan programs because they not only amplify the consequences detailed above, but they significantly burden your facility. The staff and facility resources spent on this service and field response could otherwise be put toward providing information that solves people's wildlife problems for the long term. 

As a far better alternative, the HSUS encourages "information loan" programs where people who have wildlife conflicts are given information instead of a trap. Only when the problem can't be resolved with self-help information should the caller be referred to someone who can intervene. The result of an "information loan" program is that nuisance wildlife complaints drop dramatically, the burden on animal control officers and shelter staff is greatly reduced and people learn to resolve their problems in a more effective and humane manner.
