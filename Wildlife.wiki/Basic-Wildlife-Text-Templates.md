# Wildlife Helpline Steps

## 1. Triage the call

**a. Pictures of the animal if one is not provided**
- May ask for video if it is unclear

**b. Where the animal was found, what city specifically**
- Currently, we only admit animals in our service areas
- If they took an animal home from one of our service areas and they live outside our service area, you need to make them an appointment to bring the animal in. See [How to Intake Dropped Off Animals](How-to-Intake-Dropped-Off-Animals).
- If the animal was found outside our service area, refer them to another rehabber or the Fish and Wildlife webpage with the list of permitted facilities

> "Unfortunately, we cannot take animals from outside our service area. You can take the animal to your local vet or call your local animal control to assist. You can also try calling another rehabber on this list. https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Laboratories/Wildlife-Investigations/Rehab/Facilities"

**c. Why they need help**
- "How is this animal causing a problem for you"
- "What makes you think this animal is injured/sick/orphaned"
    - You may want to ask for another picture from a different perspective to show the injury
- How long have they had/seen the animal

## 2. How to admit an animal

**a. Request tech. approval**

Only admit animals after a tech. has approved.

**b. Ask for their name and the address the animal is located**
1. Ask if they are willing to stay and watch the animal, or place in box when appropriate
    - If not, ask for exact location (under tree, on sidewalk, etc.)
2. Call dispatch (x102) and let them know they need to pick up the animal 
    - Anissia wants a screenshot text- make sure she replies back, if she doesn't in about 15min, call dispatch to make sure the call got put in
3. Provide dispatch with:
    - Type of animal getting picked up
    - Name of person (if possible)
    - Location of the animal(s)
    - Phone number of the RP (reporting party)

## 3. If you're picking up the animal

Text the RP back:

> "Thank you for the information, an officer will be there to pick up the animal. If you need to step out and won't be home, carefully place the animal in an enclosed box and leave it on your porch. The officer can pick up the animal from there. We, unfortunately, are unable to provide an ETA as the officers have to prioritize calls based on emergency and we cannot know how long they will take on each call, but the officer will be there as soon as possible. Thank you."

## 4. Messages with no context

Sometimes people send a message or picture with no context. Here is an appropriate greeting in this case:

> "Hi, thank you for contacting the Pasadena Humane Wildlife Helpline. What city are you in and how can I help you? What is the issue and can you please send pictures of the animal?"

## 5. Follow up / check in requests

Sometimes RP will ask about the status of the animal they reported/dropped off. Respond with the following and **include the WRMD ID number**:

# Reuniting Healthy, Uninjured Babies

More animals and details can be found in [WCG Orphaned animals](WCG-Orphaned-animals).

## Birds :bird:

**Attach this flyer for healthy, baby birds texts:** [Baby Bird Flow Chart](assets/pdf/Baby-Bird-Flow-Chart-2021.pdf)

**Nestling Bird:**

> "Thank you for the pictures. This is a nestling __________. If you haven't done it yet, the best thing you can do for it is try to reunite the baby back with its parents. The parents are able to provide round the clock care for the baby and they do a better job of taking care of it than we do. Please follow this flowchart." [insert [Baby Bird Flow Chart](../assets/pdf/Baby-Bird-Flow-Chart-2021.pdf)]

Further info on hatchlings/nestlings: [Nestling Reunite Script](Nestling-Reunite-Script)

> "Attach the makeshift nest, with the baby inside, to a tree or a nearby structure where you think the original nest is located. Place it as high as you can as close to the original location as possible. You may watch from a distance to see if any birds come back to the makeshift nest, but if you are too close the parents will be too scared to return. Parents do not stay with their babies because they do not want predators to find them. Parents only come back for a quick second to feed their babies then leave, so do not be alarmed if you do not see them. Please, do not feed the baby and do not check up on it often as this will scare the parents away, but please let us know if the baby's attitude changes or if you have any other questions."

Further info on how to make a nest: [Making A Nest](Making-A-Nest)

**Fledgling Bird:**

Examples in [Fledglings](Fledglings).

> "Thank you for the pictures. This is a fledgling _________. This is the age that it hops out of the nest and is learning how to fly. Fledglings stay on the ground for about 2 weeks before they gain the muscles and learn to fly away. The parents are still around to feed it and take care of it. It is best to put it back in a bush or tree near where you found it and leave it alone so the parents can continue to care for it. If you are worried about cats and other animals getting to the bird, you can place in the bushes so it can hide. You can also make a makeshift nest using a shoebox or basket (no more than 3 inches deep) and attach it to a nearby tree using some duct tape or rope. This will help the fledgling for a little while, but the fledgling will eventually hop out of the makeshift nest. Parents only come for a quick second to feed their babies then leave, so do not be alarmed if you do not see them. Please, do not feed the baby and do not check up on it often as this will scare the parents away, but please let us know if the fledgling's attitude changes or if you have any other questions."

**Window Strike Bird (with no obvious injuries):**

`PENDING REVISION UPDATES`

## Mammals

**Attach this flyer for healthy, baby mammals texts:** [Baby Mammals Flow Chart](assets/pdf/Baby-Mammal-Flow-Chart-2021.pdf)

**Squirrel (if they haven't tried reuniting yet):**

> "Hello, how long has it been since you've found the baby? Is it bleeding and are there any obvious injuries? Have you tried to reunite the baby with its parents?"

*If found in the AM:*

> "Please place the baby in a shoebox and place the shoe box back where the baby was found. You can place a makeshift heating pad (warm rice-filled sock) in the box if you'd like. Using a speaker, play some baby squirrel calls. Play the call near the baby for a few hours and leave the baby alone to see if the parents will come back for it. If the baby's attitude changes for the worse or if the baby is still there by the end of the day at around 4 pm, please let us know."

*If found in the late PM and it looks fine:*

> "We would like to give the parents the chance to come back and take their baby. Since there are a few hours of daylight left, please place the baby in a shoebox and place the shoebox back where the baby was found. You can place a makeshift heating pad (warm rice-filled sock) in the box. Using a speaker, play some baby squirrel calls. Play the call near the baby for a few hours and leave the baby alone to see if the parents will come back for it. If the baby is still there when it is dark outside, you may bring the baby inside and place it in an enclosed box in a quiet area. Place the baby outside again tomorrow morning at around 7 or 8 am to try again. Please contact us after 9am if the baby is still there. Please do not feed the baby. If the baby's attitude changes for the worse please let us know."

**Opossum dollar bill size and larger (if uninjured):**

> "This baby is fine to be on its own. This is the age that they fall off of mom's back and go venturing off on their own. You can place him back outside in a bush so he can continue exploring his surroundings and grow."

**Raccoon (if uninjured):**

> "Place the baby in a shaded area near where it was found and place a laundry basket over the baby raccoon. This prevents other animals from taking it and keeps the baby out of danger. Play some baby raccoon calls on a speaker and wait a few hours. Raccoons are nocturnal, so they are more active at night. Leave the baby out overnight to see if the mom will come back for it. The mom is able to lift the basket over to retrieve the baby. Please let us know if the baby's attitude changes. If the baby is still there tomorrow morning, please contact us after 9am."

**Skunks (if uninjured):**

> "Place the baby in a shaded area near where it was found and place a light laundry basket over the baby skunk. This prevents other animals from taking it and keeps the baby out of danger. Skunks are nocturnal, so they are more active at night but will try to find their babies in the day time. Leave the baby out overnight to see if the mom will come back for it. The mom is able to lift the basket over to retrieve the baby. Do not feed the baby or take it inside. Please let us know if the baby's attitude changes. If the baby is still there tomorrow morning, please contact us after 9am."

# Common Wildlife Conflicts

## Coyote :wolf:

**Attach this flyer to all coyote texts:** [Coyote Flyer](assets/pdf/WildlifeFlyers-Coyote.pdf)

**Nuisance Coyotes:**

> "Thank you for reaching out about coyotes in your community. Coyotes are native wildlife and are free to roam as determined under the jurisdiction of the Department of Fish and Wildlife; Pasadena Humane is not authorized to trap or relocate them. They are also a valuable part of our ecosystem, keeping rodent populations down and providing free carrion removal, among other benefits. Removing coyotes from our local ecosystem would be a massive undertaking with significant detrimental ecological consequences.
>
> Coyotes go where there are resources, and their behavior changes based on how humans react to them - so it is imperative we avoid intentionally or unintentionally providing food, water, or shelter to coyotes. Additionally, consistently hazing coyotes whenever they are on our properties or near people is the only sustainable and effective way to alter unwanted behavior. We should take every opportunity to make coyotes uncomfortable by hazing them with things like loud noises (i.e., air horns, banging pots and pans), squirting them with a hose, quickly opening and closing an umbrella, etc.
>
> In Southern California, coyotes only grow up to about 35lbs and do not naturally see humans (even children) as prey - their natural instinct is to fear humans. Children should be taught how to haze coyotes; children and pets must be supervised at all times while outside; dogs should always be kept close by and on 6ft or shorter leashes when outside; cats should be kept indoors or provided an enclosed catio for safety. Passive hazing devices like motion-sensing sprinklers and coyote rollers for fences help deter coyotes and other wildlife when you are not home.
>
> The Pasadena Humane coyote flyer includes some helpful tips on how to haze coyotes and prevent them from becoming too comfortable around humans. In addition, you can watch our Coyote Safety webinar recording any time by accessing this link.
>
> Finally, you can report all coyote sightings and encounters at https://ucanr.edu/sites/CoyoteCacher/ or email wildlife@pasadenahumane with any further questions. Thank you for your consideration and support."

## Raccoon :raccoon:

**Attach this flyer to all Raccoon texts:** [Raccoon Flyer](assets/pdf/WildlifeFlyers-Raccoon.pdf)

**Raccoon Deterrents/Raccoon in Garden:**

> "We do not trap and relocate animals, we only offer humane deterrent tips.
>
> Identify what is causing the animal to come in your area, eliminate food sources such as outdoor pet food, fruits on the ground from fruit trees. Please haze the animal by making loud noises when you see them (bang pots and pans, shake pennies in a can, use a whistle), you can also use a hose to spray them, or throw tennis balls at them to scare them off. They won't be harmed.
>
> You can place motion sensing sprinklers and lights in areas you know they are walking through. 
>
> Make a tree baffle using a large metal sheet wrapped around the trunk of the tree, the sheet needs to be at least 3 feet in length and about 3 feet off the ground."

## Skunk :skunk:

**Skunk Deterrents/Skunk in Garden:**

> "We do not trap and relocate animals, we only offer humane deterrent tips.

>
> You can place motion-sensing sprinklers and lights in areas you know they are walking through. 
>
> Skunks like to dig for bugs to eat, so eliminating that by using grub killer from your local hardware store or nursery will prevent them from coming in. Clean up your yard so they don't feel comfortable having hiding places"

## Snake :snake:

**If it is a rattlesnake in the garden, ask for a picture. Attach this flyer:** [Rattlesnake Flyer](assets/pdf/WildlifeFlyers-Rattlesnake.pdf)

The only venomous native snakes in California are sea snakes, which are found in the ocean off southern California and are rarely encountered, and rattlesnakes.

We might relocate rattlesnakes now, but call dispatch to ask first.

**For other snakes in the garden, ask for a picture:**

> "We do not trap and relocate animals, we only offer humane deterrent tips.
>
> You can leave the snake alone and it will move away on its own. You can use the hose to spray it to encourage it to leave, but make sure to stand 5 ft away.
>
> Clean your yard, rake up any leaves that are on the ground, cut your bushes/shrubs a few inches off the ground. This takes away the snake's hiding spots and makes them more uncomfortable. Pick up any fruit that has fallen and eliminate their food source (small prey, such as mice, moles and rats, as well as an array of insects, including crickets, grasshoppers, snails and slugs).
>
> There are non-toxic snake repellents that can be bought online. You can plant certain plants that are a natural deterrent to snakes, such as lemongrass, marigolds, garlic, and onions. There is a snake barrier mesh that you can buy to install in your garden to prevent other snakes from coming in. If you have any other questions, please feel free to message us back."

## Animal dens / crawl spaces / attic

> "Sprinkle a capsaicin-based repellent (such as Critter Ridder) or used kitty litter around the hole under the fence and mix it with the dirt before loosely filling the hole. Additionally, attach Mylar balloons to weights and place them 3 feet off the ground around the den opening to enhance the harassment effect. Place in the crawl space/den before nightfall. Use radios and motion detected lights in "den" areas as well. This should drive animal(s) out.
>
> To ensure the animal has left, place flour or baby powder outside the entrance and look for animal prints. Be cautious during spring and summer, as there may be a litter of young that cannot escape. Once the animal has left, seal all entrance points."
