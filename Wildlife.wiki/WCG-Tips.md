*Ten high-level tips for troubleshooting wildlife issues over the phone, including questions to ask and approaches to keep in mind.*

## 1. Calm down the caller!
- Be sure to convey empathy.
- BE NICE! Panicked people may be rude, but it's just out of fear. Help them along!

## 2. Encourage cooperation and resolve problems by:
- Being receptive.
- Taking away the threatening elements of the situation.
- Educating callers about the animal in a way they can relate to.
- Presenting a viable solution.

## 3. Get good information!

Ask enough questions - and get enough details - so that you can visualize the situation in your head.

## 4. Confirm what the person is reporting.

Are they interpreting the situation correctly?

**CONFIRM SPECIES**
- Ask about appearance, movement, size, type of injury/damage, when the animal is active, footprints, scat.

**CIRCUMSTANCES**
- How long has the animal been there?
- Could she have been attacked by a dog or cat?
- What human activities or changes in the immediate environment could have created the situation?

**ORPHAN?**
- What is the animal's approximate age (eyes open or shut? naked or downy? fully feathered/furred?)?
- Would you expect the animal to be with his mother at that age?
- Has something happened to the mother? Is she trapped?
- Was a dead adult seen nearby recently?
- How long has the animal been at that site?
- How is the animal behaving (crying? wandering? running up to people?)?
- Is the animal dehydrated (eyes sunken, skin "tenting?")?

**SICK/INJURED?**
- Why does caller think so? Remember age-specific behavior differences (e.g., fledgling).

## 5. Remember: Most animal problems are really people problems!

Figure out how the caller's behavior could be causing the problem.

## 6. For nuisance problems, eliminate the problem, not the animal!

What is attracting the animal? Food? Nesting or denning opportunity? Identify what really needs to be removed.

## 7. Assure the caller that the animal is not "out to get them."

Explain why the animal is doing what she's doing (finding food, creating a nesting site, enjoying mating season).

## 8. Assess the person's comfort level if you give them something hands-on to do.

Make sure they understand each step and what to expect.

## 9. Have good references handy!

Try the Wild Neighbors book, published by the HSUS, or visit wildneighbors.org.

## 10. Make good referrals.

- Use humanesociety.org/wildliferehab to find a wildlife rehabilitator; make sure the rehabilitator handles the species before referring the call.
- Review our guidelines for working with a nuisance wildlife control operator.
