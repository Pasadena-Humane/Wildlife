# Step 1: Meet with RP

RP should been instructed to meet in the [Goodwill parking lot](Template-Responses#meet-in-goodwill-parking). Once they have arrived:

- Go to room W5

- Wear the gloves provided

- Take the WILDLIFE INTAKE FORM

`insert image here`

- Exit through the garage door to the parking lot

# Step 2: Pick up the animal

Have the RP fill out the WILDLIFE INTAKE FORM. 

If the animal is not confined, bring an empty cardboard box to place it into. If RP wants their container back, bring the animal inside, have a technician move the animal into a new container, and then give the empty container back to RP.

# Step 3: Bring in the animal

Take the animal into room W4 and place its container onto the Wildlife Intake Shelf. There is a heating pad on top of the Wildlife Intake Shelf; try to place half the container on the heating pad and the other half off of it. This gives the animal space to move away if it gets too hot.

# Step 4: Admit the animal into WRMD

Use the WILDLIFE INTAKE FORM to [admit the animal into WRMD](WRMD-How-to-Admit-a-Patient).

Once admitted, [print a cage card](WRMD-How-to-Print-Cage-Cards) and place it next to the animal's container.
