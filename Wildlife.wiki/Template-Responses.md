# After Hours

Hello, thank you for contacting the Pasadena Humane Wildlife Helpline. It seems you have messaged us outside of our hours. We are open from 9am to 5pm daily. Please help us determine what is best for the animal by texting us a clear photo and giving as much information as possible:

1. What is your first and last name?
2. What is the address where the animal was found (or closest cross-streets)?
3. Do you see any obvious bleeding or other injuries (please include photos and videos that show this)?
4. Is the animal moving? Describe its movements.
5. Approximately how big is the animal?
6. How long have you been observing it?

We will respond to your message when we return. In most cases, it is best to refrain from intervention until a wildlife expert is available. Please see our website for information about baby animals and other wildlife concerns at https://pasadenahumane.org/services/wildlife/. For urgent help outside of our normal hours you may contact (626) 792-7151 ext. 102.

# Animals in Crawl Spaces/Attics/Eviction

Use towels soaked in apple cider vinegar or cayenne pepper diluted in water. Place them in a can with the rag sticking half in and half out so the smell can dissipate into the air. Place the can in the crawl space/den before nightfall. Use radios and motion detected lights in den areas as well. This should drive the animals out. To ensure the animal has left, place flour or baby powder outside the entrance and look for animal prints. Be cautious during spring and summer, as there may be a litter of young that cannot escape. Once the animal has left, seal all entrance points.

# Animals Welfare Above All Else

Our policy is to put the animals welfare above all else, and that includes refusing to put it through unnecessary trauma and stress which is what would happen if we were to send someone to go out and chase and attempt to capture an animal that's is still reasonably ambulatory. As stated before, please let us know if and when it is no longer mobile and we can potentially send someone to humanely euthanize and remove it.

# Avian Influenza

Due to the increase of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) cases, we are admitting waterfowl for euthanasia only. You can read more about HPAI here https://calepa.ca.gov/disaster/ainfluenza/

1. **Not Gravely Injured Waterfowls**

   Our policy is to only intervene when absolutely necessary, especially with highly stress-prone species. There is also a highly pathogenic avian influenza throughout California, so we are even MORE careful about which birds we are admitting. It has been detected in mainly waterfowl and some scavenging species (like raptors and corvids). Since the condition of this animal is not severe enough to justify automatic euthanasia, we recommend the animal be left alone. If there is any slight possibility this animal can recover on its own, we would like to give it that opportunity. If its condition deteriorates further, please contact us again. You might want to contact IBR (International Bird Rescue) as well to see if they have the capacity to intake it.

2. **Orphaned Waterfowls**

   a. Try to REUNITE
   b. Intake if reunion was unsuccessful

# Bear Info

Thank you for reaching out about bears in your community. This flyer includes information and helpful tips: https://pasadenahumane.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/23_4_Wildlife-Flyers_Web_Bear.pdf

Bears are native wildlife and are free to roam as determined under the jurisdiction of the Department of Fish and Wildlife; Pasadena Humane is not authorized to trap or relocate them. They are also a valuable part of our ecosystem. We are not authorized to do anything with bears without the direction of Fish and Wildlife.

Bears go where there are resources, and their behavior changes based on how humans react to them - so it is imperative we avoid intentionally or unintentionally providing food, water, or shelter to them.

Additionally, consistently hazing bears whenever they are on our properties or near people is the only sustainable and effective way to alter unwanted behavior. We should take every opportunity to make them uncomfortable by hazing them with things like loud noises (i.e., air horns, banging pots and pans), squirting them with a hose, quickly opening and closing an umbrella, etc.

In Southern California, black bears do not naturally see humans (even children) as prey - their natural instinct is to fear humans. Children should be taught how to haze. Passive hazing devices like motion-sensing sprinklers and bear fencing help deter bears and other wildlife when you are not home, but the most effective thing is to make sure there are no food, water, or shelter resources that would attract the bear to the property in the first place. 

We recommend children and pets be supervised at all times while outside, dogs be kept close by and on 6 ft or shorter leashes, and cats be kept indoors or provided an enclosed catio for safety.

You can email wildlife@pasadenahumane.org with any further questions. Thank you for your consideration and support.

# Bobcat Info

Thank you for reaching out about bobcats in your community. This flyer includes information and helpful tips: https://pasadenahumane.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/23_4_Wildlife-Flyers_Web_Bobcat.pdf

Bobcats are native wildlife and are free to roam as determined under the jurisdiction of the Department of Fish and Wildlife; Pasadena Humane is not authorized to trap or relocate them. They are also a valuable part of our ecosystem, keeping rodent populations down and providing free carrion removal, among other benefits. Bobcats are opportunistic carnivores and will eat whatever they can catch. Although they prefer rabbits and rodents, bobcats will also eat small reptiles, birds, feral cats, eggs, and occasionally deer and small livestock. Bobcats do most of their hunting at dawn, dusk, and through the night, but will come out whenever it is most convenient for them to find resources.

Bobcats go where there are resources, and their behavior changes based on how humans react to them - so it is imperative we avoid intentionally or unintentionally providing food, water, or shelter to bobcats.

Hazing bobcats whenever they are on our properties or near people is the only sustainable and effective way to alter unwanted behavior. We should take every opportunity to make bobcats uncomfortable around humans by hazing them with things like loud noises (i.e. air horns, banging pots and pans), squirting them with a hose, quickly opening and closing an umbrella, etc.

In Southern California, bobcats only grow on average to around 20 lbs and do not naturally see humans (even children) as prey - their natural instinct is to fear humans and tend to be solitary and shy. Children should be taught how to haze. Passive hazing devices like motion-sensing sprinklers and coyote rollers for fences help deter bobcats and other wildlife when you are not home.

We recommend children and pets be supervised at all times while outside, dogs be kept close by and on 6 ft or shorter leashes, and cats be kept indoors or provided an enclosed catio for safety.

You can email wildlife@pasadenahumane.org with any further questions. Thank you for your consideration and support.

# Coyote Info

Thank you for reaching out about coyotes in your community. This flyer includes information and helpful tips: https://pasadenahumane.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/23_4_Wildlife-Flyers_Web_Coyote.pdf

Coyotes are native wildlife and are free to roam as determined under the jurisdiction of the Department of Fish and Wildlife; Pasadena Humane is not authorized to trap or relocate them. They are also a valuable part of our ecosystem, keeping rodent populations down and providing free carrion removal, among other benefits. Removing coyotes from our local ecosystem would be a massive undertaking with significant detrimental ecological consequences.

Coyotes go where there are resources, and their behavior changes based on how humans react to them - so it is imperative we avoid intentionally or unintentionally providing food, water, or shelter to coyotes.

Additionally, consistently hazing coyotes whenever they are on our properties or near people is the only sustainable and effective way to alter unwanted behavior. We should take every opportunity to make coyotes uncomfortable by hazing them with things like loud noises (i.e. air horns, banging pots and pans), squirting them with a hose, quickly opening and closing an umbrella, etc.

In Southern California, coyotes only grow up to about 35 lbs and do not naturally see humans (even children) as prey - their natural instinct is to fear humans. Children should be taught how to haze. Passive hazing devices like motion-sensing sprinklers and coyote rollers for fences help deter coyotes and other wildlife when you are not home.

We recommend children and pets be supervised at all times while outside, dogs be kept close by and on 6 ft or shorter leashes, and cats be kept indoors or provided an enclosed catio for safety.

You can watch our Coyote Safety webinar here: https://register.gotowebinar.com/recording/5490342450487901953

Finally, you can report all coyote sightings and encounters at https://ucanr.edu/sites/CoyoteCacher/ or email wildlife@pasadenahumane.org with any further questions. Thank you for your consideration and support.

## Coyote Still Mobile

Hi thanks for contacting Pasadena Humane Wildlife Helpline. Since the coyote is still mobile, we are unable to send out an officer for him. Capture is highly stressful and poses a risk to them and our staff, so we want to make sure that an impound is absolutely necessary as it is the last resort. If the coyote’s condition deteriorates such that he is lateral and unable to get away, loses function of 2 limbs, and is unresponsive to hazing (using loud noises or spraying with water), then go ahead and contact us again at this number or our dispatch line. The hours for this wildlife helpline are 9am-5pm. Our dispatch line is (626) 792-7151 ext 102.

## Coyote With Mange

Hi thanks for contacting Pasadena Humane Wildlife Helpline. We do not have the authority or resources to treat these animals in the field and our policy is that we do not trap or capture animals that are still mobile as the stress of capture is dangerous for all humans and wildlife involved. Also, mange is endemic in their population and they can recover from that without our intervention. If it worsens to a condition where the coyote cannot walk or stand, please call our dispatch at (626) 792-7151 ext 102. In the meantime, please treat it like all other coyotes and haze whenever it is in the vicinity of humans so that it doesn't become too comfortable with humans. Please let me know if you have any questions.

# Dead or Deceased Pickup

Thank you for contacting Pasadena Humane Wildlife Helpline. We're sorry to hear about that. You can dispose of the body yourself in a trash bag, bury it, or we can send an officer to pick up the animal.

# Deer Still Mobile

Hi thanks for contacting Pasadena Humane Wildlife Helpline. Unfortunately, we are unable to send an officer as the deer is still mobile. It is actually extremely difficult to rehab adult deer and there are really no rehab centers in Southern California that do. This is because they are extremely prone to capture myopathy resulting in death from the stress of capture. Also, they often further gravely injure themselves in the process of capture if they don’t die from it. This is really the best option for the deer. Below is a link with some more information. Please contact us if its condition deteriorates and it is no longer mobile. Thank you for your care and compassion for wildlife. 

https://www.nativeanimalrescue.org/found-an-animal/deer/

# Donate

Thank you for assisting wildlife in distress. Your ongoing support is vital to the wildlife in our community. As a non-profit organization, we rely on donations to care for the thousands of wild animals who need our care each year. Please consider giving today to help ensure we can continue this critical program: http://pasadenahumane.org/supportwildlife.

# First Response - Distressed Animal

Hello, thank you for contacting the Pasadena Humane Wildlife Helpline. This is not an emergency service and our team is working hard attending to animals currently in care. We will respond as soon as we are able. If you are contacting about injured or sick wildlife, and haven't done so already, please help us determine what is best for the animal by texting us a clear photo and giving as much information as possible:

1. What is your first and last name?
2. What is the address where the animal was found (or closest cross-streets)?
3. Do you see any obvious bleeding or other injuries (please include photos and videos that show this)?
4. Is the animal moving? Describe its movements.
5. Approximately how big is the animal?
6. How long have you been observing it?

Thank you for your help with this and we will assist you as soon as we are able.

# Fledglings

Thank you for the pictures. This is a fledgling. At this age they start hopping out of their nest and learning how to fly. These fledglings may stay on the ground for up to 2 weeks before they gain the muscles and learn to fly away. The parents are still around to feed and hydrate it and take care of it but this only take a few seconds so it’s easy to miss. Please, do not feed the baby and do not check up on it often as this will scare the parents away, but please let us know if the fledgling's condition deteriorates, if it is closing its eyes for long periods, or if it can no longer sit up. You should release it back under some or natural covering as close as you can near where you found it.

# Humane Exclusion Service

Hello, thanks for reaching out about conflicts with wildlife. The Pasadena Humane Wildlife Program is currently piloting a humane wildlife exclusion service where we help residents and business owners with nuisance wildlife issues as an alternative to conventional pest control companies which often trap and euthanize wildlife. It's important for you to know that we do not trap and relocate wildlife. If you have an animal living in your walls, attic, or under your house, we provide free advice after an initial inspection. This allows us to give precise and accurate advice that is specific to your needs. All situations are different, and we want to find the best solution for you. The initial inspection cost for a site visit is $145. You can find a detailed breakdown of services on our website https://pasadenahumane.org/services/wildlife/humane-wildlife-exclusion/

If you are looking for advice on how to handle an exclusion yourself, please refer to https://awces.com/self-help where you can find great information on DIY solutions. We do not, unfortunately, have the extra time and resources to spend on the phone giving self-help advice. 

Please let us know if you have additional questions or are interested in scheduling an initial site inspection.

# Humane Pest Control - Rats

Pasadena Humane only does a site inspection for rats. We recommend Humane Pest Control Inc for the whole service: https://humanepestpro.com or call 844-PEST-PRO. 

Thank you for addressing your conflicts with compassion!

# If RP Only Left Voicemail

Hi we received your voicemail about _____. Thank you so much for reaching out, we apologize for missing your call. Our hotline runs through a text-only messaging system as our team is working hard attending to animals currently in care. Please reply to this text message for the fastest response.

# Illegal for Public to Rehab

The California Code of Regulations, Title 14, Section 679, states that the public has 48 hours to contact the Department of Fish and Game or a licensed rehabilitator to place an injured or orphaned wild animal.

It is in the best interest of the animal that it is surrendered to us or another wildlife rehabilitation facility as soon as possible. We hold specific permits issued by Fish and Wildlife in order to legally keep any wildlife in captivity. These permits are in place because wildlife undergoes extreme stress when captive. It is not legal for the public to keep wildlife without these permits. Wildlife requires very specific care and can often die from what is called capture myopathy in the hands of well-meaning rescuers. Please let us know if you would like the bring the animal in or if we should send another officer. If you would like to find another rescue, below is a list of permit-holding centers, but please understand that no humane wildlife facility will keep an animal alive that is suffering or cannot survive in the wild on its own.

https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Laboratories/Wildlife-Health/Rehab/Facilities

# Illegal to Relocate

It is illegal to relocate wildlife in the state of California per Section 465.5 of 14 of the California Code of Regulations. So, it is not a service we provide. Please let this animal go in the exact area it was trapped. 

# Meet in Goodwill Parking

Thank you very much for your willingness to transport this animal! Since you will be in close quarters with a wild animal, please keep this in mind: in order to minimize any additional stress please refrain from playing loud music, talking should be kept to a whisper, keep the animal in an enclosed, covered container and refrain from peeking at it. If possible, please place the animal in a secure location such as the passenger side floor in the vehicle to prevent constant/sudden movements during the car ride. Do not smoke or bring along pets while transporting the animal. 

Please head to Goodwill parking lot just behind Pasadena Humane: 340 S Fair Oaks, Pasadena, CA 91105

We have two reserved parking spots in the South East section of the Goodwill parking lot for our Wildlife Department. The final image shows the main entrance (in green)  which gives you access to ARC and foster office and where you will be dropping off (in blue). Stay in your car when you arrive and text this number. Someone will be out to meet you as soon as they are available. Thank you for your willingness to help our wild neighbors! 

# Nestling Reunite

Since this a nestling, the bird’s legs might not be strong enough to walk on its own yet. We advise you to try and re-nest the bird to see if its parents are still around. Please get a small container such as a box, poke holes in it and line it with tissue paper and some twigs or leaves. Make sure to poke some holes on the bottom of the box. Place the makeshift nest with the baby bird on a nearby tree or tall bush - somewhere sturdy. You can tape the makeshift nest or use zip ties if you have to. The mom would make that her nest and take care of her baby from it. You may watch from a distance to see if any birds come back to the makeshift nest, but if you are too close the parents will be too scared to return. Parents only come back for a quick second to feed their babies then leave, so do not be alarmed if you do not see them. Please do not feed the baby and do not check up on it often as this will scare the parents away. Please let us know if the baby’s condition changes or if you have any other questions.

# Not in Our Service Area

Hello, thank you for contacting the Pasadena Humane Wildlife Helpline. Unfortunately, we are only allowed to accept animals from inside our 11 service cities. You can read more about it here: https://pasadenahumane.org/services/animal-care-and-control/animal-control

We suggest finding another rehabilitation center here: https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Laboratories/Wildlife-Health/Rehab/Facilities

This is also a list of animal shelters in Los Angeles County and can help you find your appropriate contact for animal control services: https://acwm.lacounty.gov/animal-control-shelter-services/

You may also try contacting your local exotic veterinary clinic.

# Peafowl Deterrents

Thank you for reaching about peafowls in your community. This flyer includes information and helpful tips: https://pasadenahumane.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/23_4_Wildlife-Flyers_Web_Peafowl.pdf

- Peafowls do not like water: Water is one of the best-known deterrents for peafowl. The intermittent use of sprinklers or a hose with a jet nozzle will act as a negative reinforcement for the birds. Also, consider a motion sensor activated water spray, such as the Scarecrow, which is battery operated and covers an area of about 35 feet and can be connected to your garden hose. It's  available online or at garden stores such as OSH.

- Avoid planting young tender seedlings in areas you do not want peafowl to visit or cover the plants until they're well established. There are also a variety of plants peafowl do NOT eat/like and can help with deterrence. You can read more about it here: https://www.rpvca.gov/510/Dealing-with-Peafowl#:~:text=Cat%20repellent%20and%20mothballs%20around,around%20the%20property%20and%20neighborhood

- Peafowls will avoid certain repellents: Cat repellent and mothballs around planting beds, porches, and along walkways may be an effective means of repelling peafowl. Caution should be used so as not to allow young children or animals to ingest the repellents.

- Peafowls are afraid of dogs: Walk your dog around the property and neighborhood.

- Peafowls like to eat seeds, bugs, and worms: Avoid open compost and manure sacks. If you wish to compost, use a covered compost bin and keep the composting area clean.•Peafowl like to eat wild birdseed, bread, and pet food. These are delectable treats to peafowl. Once they're hooked, it's difficult to wean them. It's a good idea to remove any leftover pet food immediately or feed pets indoors.
- Peafowls prefer to roost in safe areas, such as overhanging trees: Trim or thin overhanging trees as often as possible to avoid roosting.

- Sprinkle coyote urine (purchased at feed stores) around the perimeter of the property.

# Snake ID

Please review the following links to identify the species of snake. Gopher snakes are often mistaken for rattlesnakes although they are almost harmless and very beneficial pest control. Dangerous venomous snakes have a large, wide head with cat-eye pupils in their eyes, and large scales on their body.

# Will You Treat the Animal or Just Kill It?

Hello, thank you for contacting the Pasadena Humane Wildlife Helpline. We appreciate the willingness to help out, but this animal is a wild animal and therefore needs to be taken care by trained wildlife rehabbers. Our policy is to put the animal's welfare above all else. In some situations, humane euthanasia is the best outcome for certain animals when their injuries are extensive or will greatly limit their ability to survive in the wild. Our team is going to provide the medical treatment it needs. Thank you for taking care of an animal in distress! For updates you can email wildlife@pasadenahumane.org
