# Critical Care Procedures/Guiding Principles/Etiquette

Caring for wildlife requires a specialized environment to ensure that we are providing the best possible outcome for our patients. This etiquette outlines the basics of what we need to ensure we are providing the best care for the rehabilitation of our wildlife patients.

**1. Reduce Noise**
- Conversations should take place outside of the wildlife rooms
- Low voices when around enclosures and in any rooms where animals are housed
- Appropriate nature sounds can be played for the patients
- Phones-all calls to be taken out of rooms where animals are housed
- All room doors should be closed 

**2. Reduce Patient Stress**
- Cover all cages/brooders/enclosures with appropriately sized towel including during transport
- Do not check cages until you are ready to work in the cage (no-peeking rule)
- Hoods or shield the patients head/eyes  to help reduce stress when handling

**3. Reduce Escapes**
- Room doors should be closed at all times
- Utilize the safety doors appropriately. No two doors should be open at the same time
- Nets and capture equipment should be easily accessible in all animal areas and well maintained 
- Before entering a room or enclosure ensure it is safe to do so
- All caging should be secured/closed when not directly working with patients

**4. Reduce Disease transmission**
- Wash hands before and after handling animals
- All work areas and feeding equipment are to be kept clean and disinfected
- PPE should be used when appropriate/necessary 
- Change, clean, and disinfect housing daily
- No food or drink is allowed in animal areas or next to animal housing - closed water bottles are okay
- Transport containers and crates must be cleaned and stored neatly and ready for use

**5. Reduce Food-Borne diseases**
- All food should be stored and labeled appropriately
- Food freshness and quality should be assessed and old/expired food should be discarded
- Animal's food dishes should be changed often and kept fresh
- Dishes cleaned and disinfected/sanitized as per the sanitation protocol 
- Water should be kept clean and fresh
- The kitchen should be kept clean and neat at all times
- All animal food and medication must be stored separately from human food 

**6. Reduce Disruptions**
- Only enter rooms as needed
- Prepare all items needed before handling animals for exams or treatment
- Limit number of people for each room

**7. Reduce Injury**
- Tools, nets, and hoses stored neatly and safely
- Maintain awareness of where the animals are housed in relation to other animals and humans
- Keep pathways clear
- House animals in appropriate-size and type of enclosures (ie, prevent feather damage by never housing birds in wire caging)
