# Relevant Natural History

The American black bear is one of three species of bear found in the United States, along with brown (grizzly) bears and polar bears. Black bears are the smallest species, are the most adapted to urban and suburban areas, and are found in 40 states. They are solitary animals, although cubs stay with their mothers for two to three years. Bears have an extraordinary sense of smell, allowing them to find a variety of foods—including those enticing morsels on grills and in garbage cans and dumpsters. They are particularly voracious in late summer/early fall as they put on extra fat for winter's long hibernation. During this time (called hyperphagia), they can consume 20,000 calories a day!

# Bears Getting into Trash

**ADVICE:** Trash provides a huge enticement to bears. The only solution is to prevent access by using bear-proof trash containers or by storing trash in a way that does not attract or allow access by bears. This means never letting garbage pile up - or letting odors develop - by storing garbage in tightly closed plastic bags and secure trash containers, putting trash out just before curbside pickup, and never storing garbage in places like porches or open garages. It's also important to not discard cooking grease in the yard. There are a variety of effective bear-proof dumpster and garbage container companies and designs available; see bearsmart.com for examples. Once the bears are no longer able to use this easy food source, they will go elsewhere.

# Bears Raiding Bird Feeders

**ADVICE:** Ideally, people living in bear country should avoid putting out bird feeders from April 1 to November 30. Birdseed is a big attractant for bears, bringing them into neighborhoods where they may also start taking advantage of trash and other food items. If the caller must keep out bird feeders, we recommend switching to sunflower hearts (instead of whole seeds), avoiding seed mixes with millet (birds toss it out) and cleaning up any spillage each day. Callers can also try hanging feeders from a thick cable out of reach of bears, at least 11 feet off the ground. They can then wrap metal flashing around tree trunks to prevent bears from climbing up to access the cable. Find bear-proof feeder designs at bearsmart.com.

# Bear Sighting in Yard/Neighborhood

**ADVICE:** If the caller is inside, tell them to stay there until the bear leaves. If the caller is outside, tell them to stand and face the bear directly, raise their arms over their head and yell toward the bear. They may also bang pots and pans or use other noisemaking devices. (Tell the caller not to run away from a bear; they can easily outrun humans, and a running human can trigger a bear to charge.) Once the bear leaves, have the caller examine their yard and neighborhood to find and remove any food source that may have attracted the bear, such as trash, bird feeders, open compost, uncleaned barbecue grills, etc.

# Fear of Being Attacked by Bear

**ADVICE:** Black bear attacks on people are extremely rare. Most black bears are very wary of people and are easily scared away by the hazing tips given above. In the rare event that a bear aggressively approaches a person, they should raise their arms over their head, yell at the bear and back away slowly (never running away). If callers believe they might encounter a bear, they should equip themselves with bear spray. If the bear makes contact and attacks, they should fight back—but make sure they know not to play dead. 

**ACTIONABLE:** If the caller, a family member or pet is actually attacked by a bear, tell them to wash the wound with soap and water (wear gloves if handling a potentially bitten pet) and to contact the local health department and their own doctor (or veterinarian) for guidance. Gather as much information about circumstance and context (such as whether or not feeding or pets were involved, etc.) and contact the state wildlife agency as appropriate.

# Bears Getting into Pet Food

**ADVICE:** The golden rule is to never feed pets outdoors, especially in bear country. Doing so literally trains bears and other wildlife to come to people's homes for food. If pets must be fed outside (for example, if someone takes care of a community cat colony), instruct the caller to leave the food outdoors for an hour at most and to clean up the leftover food immediately. Community cats are adaptable and will quickly learn this new feeding schedule.

# Bears Raiding Compost Pile

**ADVICE:** Instruct the caller to keep compost as odor-free as possible by constantly turning it and using lime and dry grass clippings to hasten decomposition. Never introduce meat, fish, oil, grease or dairy products into compost; these items will attract bears. Most importantly, tell callers to use a bear-proof composter (see bearsmart.com for more information and examples).

# Bears Eating From Fruit Trees

**ADVICE:** Bears have a sweet tooth and love fruit. In bear country, it's best to landscape with non-fruit-bearing trees and shrubs, especially around busy paths, children's play areas and other high-use locations. If the caller already has established fruit trees, tell them to pick fruit just before it ripens, diligently remove fallen fruit from the ground below and use electric fencing to protect orchards and gardens from hungry bears.

# Bears Interested in Chicken Coops

**ADVICE:** To protect chickens from bears—as well as many other wild and domestic predators—it is crucial to predator-proof their enclosures. For nighttime protection, keep chickens in bear-resistant coops that are fully enclosed using solid wood construction and heavy-gauge wire (14-gauge or better) fastened with screws and washers over any vents or openings. Any access doors to the coop should have locks. During the day, runs and other areas enclosed by electric fencing can protect chickens from bears. Although bears can get through many barriers, they do pay attention to electric fencing, making it both necessary and effective. A well-trained guard dog or other guard animal can also be helpful in preventing bear intrusions.

# Bears Raiding Beehives and Gardens

**ADVICE:** Electric fencing—including portable electric fences—is highly recommended. Not only does it deter bears, but it teaches them to stay away from callers' food sources. This kind of fencing can be used to protect fruit orchards, livestock enclosures, beehives and grain storage areas. Callers can enhance the effect by attaching foil strips to the top wire (at 24 inches of height) and smearing peanut butter or honey on the strips. This will encourage the bear to interact with the fence, giving him a quick jolt and teaching him to stay away. For information about electric fencing, visit bearsmart.com/work/beekeepers.
